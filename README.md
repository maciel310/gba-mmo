# GBA MMO

This is the actual game implementation for GBA MMO, the first MMORPG for the GameBoy Advance system. To get the game visit
the project's [itch.io page](https://maciel310.itch.io/gba-mmo).

Due to the online nature of the game you can't simply load this up in an emulator or flash cart. You'll need to connect a
GameLink cable to a Raspberry Pi, and run some additional software. On the plus side, no flash cart is required with this approach.
You can find instructions on how to make this cable in the [proxy repository](https://github.com/maciel310/gba-mmo-proxy).

If you have any questions or would like to chat about the game please join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/B3wJYnUswN).


## Credit

Most of the artwork used in this project is from opengameart.org. In particular, the map and character
tiles are from [Zelda-like tilesets and sprites](https://opengameart.org/content/zelda-like-tilesets-and-sprites) (licensed CC0),
and the icons are from [496 pixel art icons...](https://opengameart.org/content/496-pixel-art-icons-for-medievalfantasy-rpg)
(licensed CC0). Some art assets have been modified by me from those sources and are also licensed as CC0.

This game is inspired partly by a game I grew up playing, RuneScape. Some gameplay mechanics will be very familiar to people
who have played it before, and some areas are named as an homage to the game.
